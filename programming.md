The Programming for Data Science course is aimed at providing students 
with the skills necessary to use Python for data analysis in scientific 
computing. In particular the course will cover:

* Python 3.5
* The NumPy package for scientific computing
* The pandas data analysis library, including reading and writing of CSV files
* The Jupyter and PyDev development environments
* The Matplotlib 2D plotting library 
* Understanding the shell
* Using Git and GitHub
* Best-practice software engineering techniques

The course will be based on the excellent [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) 
curriculum and will incorporate pair-programming and live coding. The course will take a
student-centered, active learning, approach to teaching this material. Class
will typically consist of a short introductions to programming techniquess, followed by 
hands on computing exercises.
